# Task
## Let’s build a search engine!
The page should look similarly to Google’s, a textual logo and a search box in the middle​ of the page and with an autocomplete functionality for the results.

Use the following API: `h​ttps://jikan.moe/`

As I type, I want to get matching results with a highlight on a match, and it should work and look similarly on Mobile and Desktop devices.

Please use R​eact.js​ but you are free to choose what ever other packages you may need as you see fit.

Make sure that:
- You h​ ighlight​ the match in the results.
- It looks and works great on Mobile devices as well.
- Make it look nice.
